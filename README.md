# PerFitShiny
This repository contains a [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) application that allows performing a person-fit analysis of results from exams, categorized as correct responses (codified as 1s) and incorrect ones (codified as 0s).

In order to run the app the easiest way would be:
```R
shiny::runGitHub("shiny_example", "rstudio")
```
